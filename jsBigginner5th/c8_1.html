// should have a heading telling you what page is loaded. For example:
// <h2>Welcome to the Legacy page. You need to upgrade!</h2>
// Using feature detection and the location object, send browsers that do not support
// geolocation to legacy.html; send browsers that do support geolocation to modern.html.
